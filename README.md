# KS_test_hemispherical
A Hemispherical Comparison code using HEALPix and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for probing isotropy

Uses the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and a hemispherical comparison method to test the isotropy of distribution a quantity (here the morphological types of galaxies). It uses the HEALPix software for pixelasation of the sky sphere.

The sample data is from the HyperLeda database:http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/

# Python modules: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, math, healpy
